# Ex2 - review

The system allows to download NMEA files and save them into a database, also the system allows to make CSV and KML files from the database.

# Software 
##VisualGPS

VisualGPS (Freeware) incorporates many advanced features found in professional programs.  Its sole purpose is to display graphically specific NMEA 0183 sentences and show the effects of selective availability (SA).

###Features:

* Azimuth and Elevation Graph - View all satellites that are in view. Each satellite identifies its pseudo random number (PRN) and its azimuth and elevation. Also plot and print  the physical mask angle.
* Survey - The survey window displays both position and xDOP (HDOP and VDOP) parameters. The ability for user selectable HDOP/VDOP color thresholds for position averaging make a great utility. Also monitor Standard Deviation and effects of Selective Availability. That's not all - print the results graphically. (Click here for example print output) (in PDF format - 157K)
* Signal Quality/SNR Window - Monitor satellite signal to noise ratios and see them graphically on the screen. The signal quality window will grow or shrink to accommodate number of satellites in view.
* Navigation - Monitor latitude, longitude and altitude.
* NMEA Command Monitor - View NMEA sentences as they are received.

##NMEA to KMZ file converter

* Upload NMEA files to database by MySQL.
* Select the wanted data from the NMEA files.
* Choose the file type that convert to KML or CSV.

###Features:

* Can choose the output of five forms of KMZ, KML, GPX, NMEA and CSV. 
* Track point can output information (KMZ, KML). 
At data number, date, time, latitude,ralph lauren polos, longitude, speed, altitude by the choice output. 
Can change a unit of speed in Km / h, mph and kt. 
Convert the time into local time and can output it. 
* Can choose an icon of a track point (Normal and Overspeed) (KMZ, KML). 
* Can select a Line color and Line width of a track (KMZ, KML). 
* Masks by HDOP, NSAT and thinning out by time and distance can be output. 
* Select the multiple files and batch conversion is possible. 
* Command-line option and drag & drop are supported. 
* Output by a 3D mode is possible and detailed output condition can be set (KMZ, KML). 
It is possible to display it by replacing the speed with altitude. 
* The range of the output is definable at time. 
* On / Off can output Track and Placemark (KMZ, KML).
